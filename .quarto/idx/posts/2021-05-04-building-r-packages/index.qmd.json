We will begin by creating an empty R package and taking a tour!\n\nOpen your R code editor, and find out where you are:\n\n``` r\ngetwd()\n```\n\nThis is to prepare for the next step, where we will choose a location for our R package folder. Please be intentional about where you place your R package! Do not place it in the same space as another package, Rstudio project or other project. Create a new and isolated location for it.\n\nI am working from an existing R project in my typical R Projects folder, so I go up one level:\n\n``` r\nusethis::create_package(\"../netwerk\")\n```\n\n<aside>we are sticking with `usethis` because we want to keep this general.

We will do this MANY TIMES.\n\n``` r\ndevtools::check()\n```\n\nWe should see some warnings! let's keep these in mind as we continue our tour.\n\n### The DESCRIPTION file\n\nThe most important file to notice is the DESCRIPTION.
