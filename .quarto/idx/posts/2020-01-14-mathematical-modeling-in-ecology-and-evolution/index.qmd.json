I will also show some example code and provide translation of most of what I present in a free software package called Maxima.\n\n#### Mathematica installation\n\nThere is a free trial version that you can use for 15 days, if you don't have a copy (click [here](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/trial/) to access), or you can buy a [student version](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/pricing/students/) online. If you want to make sure that all is working, copy the code below, put your cursor over each of the following lines and press enter (on some computers, \"enter\" is a separate button, on others, press \"shift\" and \"return\" at the same time):\n\n``` mathematica\nD[x^3,x]\nListPlot[Table[x, {x,1,10}],Joined->True]\nRSolve[{x[t+1]\\[Equal]A x[t],x[0]\\[Equal]x0},x[t],t]\nPDF[NormalDistribution[0,1],x]\n```\n\nYou should see (a) $3x^2$, (b) a plot of a line, (c) ${{x[t]->A^t x0}}$, and (d) $\\frac{e^\\frac{-x^2}{2}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi }}$.\n\n#### Maxima installation:\n\nOn a Mac, install using the instructions [here](https://themaximalist.org/about/my-mac-os-installation/). For other file systems, download [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/maxima/files/).\n\n#### Maxima testing\n\nWhen you first open Maxima, it will give you a choice of GUIs, chose wxMaxima. Once wxMaxima is launched type this command and hit return to see if it answers 4:\n\n``` maxima\n2+2;\n```\n\nIf it doesn't, then scan the installation document for the error that you run into.\n\nIf it does return 4, then type in and enter these commands:\n\n``` maxima\ndiff(x^3, x);\n\nwxplot2d (3*x, [x, 0, 2*%pi]);\n\nload(\"solve_rec\")$\nsolve_rec(x[t+1] = A*x[t], x[t], x[0]=x0);\n\nload(\"distrib\")$\npdf_normal(x,0,1);\n```\n\nYou should see (a) $3x^2$, (b) a plot of a line, (c) ${{x[t]->A^t x0}}$, and (d) $\\frac{e^\\frac{-x^2}{2}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi }}$.\n\n### Material\n\n|                            Mathematica                             |                             Maxima                              |                      PDF                      |\n|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|\n|           [Notebook](files/BIOS2_WorkshopMathematica.nb)           |           [Notebook](files/Bios2_WorkshopMaxima.wxmx)           |                 Embeded below                 |\n| [Hints and solutions](files/BIOS2_WorkshopMathematicaSOLUTIONS.nb) | [Hints and solutions](files/Bios2_WorkshopMaximaSOLUTIONS.wxmx) |                                               |\n|                                                                    |                                                                 |        [Homework](files/Homework1.pdf)        |\n|            [Homework answers](files/HomeworkAnswers.nb)            |                                                                 | [Homework answers](files/HomeworkAnswers.pdf) |\n|                 [Guide](files/MathematicaGuide.nb)                 |             [Guide](files/MaximaQuickReference.wxm)             |                                               |\n\n#### Follow along PDF\n\nThis PDF was generated from the Mathematica notebook linked above.
