# Biodiversity Changes and Data Visualization

The 2022 edition of the Biodiversity Modelling Summer School was presented by Dominique Gravel and Vincent Beauregard (Université de Sherbrooke) as well as several invited experts and partners. 

It took place from August 22 to August 26 2022 in the form of a retreat at the Jouvence Resort in Orford in the heart of the Eastern Townships.

The intensive summer school is supported by Université de Sherbrooke and the NSERC-CREATE Training program in computational biodiversity science and services BIOS².

## General objective 

Massive, complex and sometimes real-time data offer new opportunities for biodiversity monitoring. Data science uses a variety of methods to extract knowledge from multi-dimensional information systems to address a wide range of applications and disciplines. The increasing availability of information on biodiversity and its changes also comes with a challenge of communication and representation, not only to scientists but also to policy makers and the general public. Biodiversity science is no exception and quantitative ecologists are called upon to develop communication techniques and tools to assist decision making. This process, often referred to as business intelligence, relies on a set of skills that range from consulting with partners to the production of interactive applications, through the creation of data models and analysis schemes.

At the end of this course, students will be able to conceptualize and develop a communication strategy based on biodiversity data to meet the needs of a partner.

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

+ Formulate an intervention plan based on business intelligence principles
+ Identify the information needs of a partner
+ Characterize the profile of data users
+ Set up a data model specific to the communication strategy
+ Conceptualize an interactive dashboard in the form of a model

## Pedagogical approach

The course is based on a strategic communication mandate for a partner organization. Students will conduct a consultation to identify information needs and develop the appropriate data model. Sessions consist of short lectures on theoretical concepts presented by specialists from different disciplines, interspersed with specific exercises designed to practice the elements taught and apply them to their consulting problem. The projects are based on data organized and distributed by Biodiversité Québec.

## Materials
