This workshop will focus on how a single tool, the R mgcv package, can be used to fit Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to data from a wide range of sources.\"\nauthor:\n  - name: \"Eric Pedersen\"\n    affiliation: Concordia University\ndate: \"11-02-2021\"\nimage: image.jpg\ncategories: [Technical, EN]\ntoc: true\nnumber-sections: true\nnumber-depth: 1\n---\n\n\n\n\n# Introduction to Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)\n\nA short course on how to fit, plot, and evaluate GAMs\n\nThe course website URL  available at [pedersen-fisheries-lab.github.io/one-day-gam-workshop/](https://pedersen-fisheries-lab.github.io/one-day-gam-workshop/)\n\n## Overview\n\nThis is a 3-session, one-day workshop. It was developed with the goal of giving you enough GAM knowledge to feel comfortable fitting and working with GAMs in your day-to-day modelling practice, with just enough of more advanced applications to give a flavour of what GAMs can do. I will be covering a basic intro to GAM theory, with the rest focused on practical applications and a few advanced topics that I think might be interesting.\n\n## Learning Goals\n\n-   Understand the basic GAM model, basis functions, and penalties\n-   Fit 1D, 2D, and tensor-product GAMs to normal and non-normal data\n-   Plot GAM fits, and understand how to explain GAM outputs\n-   Diagnose common mispecification problems when fitting GAMs\n-   Use GAMs to make predictions about new data, and assess model uncertainty\n-   See how more complicated GAM models can be used as part of a modern workflow\n\n## Setup\n\n  - You will need to install **R** and I recommend using **RStudio**. The\n    latest version of R can be downloaded\n    [here](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html). RStudio is an application\n    (an integrated development environment or IDE) that facilitates the use of R\n    and offers a number of nice additional features. It can be downloaded\n    [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). You will need\n    the free Desktop version for your computer.\n\n  - Download the course materials as a ZIP file\n    [here](https://github.com/pedersen-fisheries-lab/one-day-gam-workshop/archive/main.zip).\n    Alternatively, if you have the [**usethis**](), R package, running the\n    following command will download the course materials and open them:\n\n    ``` {.r}\n    usethis::use_course('pedersen-fisheries-lab/one-day-gam-workshop')\n    ```\n\n  - Install the R packages required for this course by running the following\n    line of code your R console:\n\n    ``` {.r}\n    install.packages(c(\"dplyr\", \"ggplot2\", \"remotes\", \"mgcv\", \"tidyr\"))\n    remotes::install_github(\"gavinsimpson/gratia\")\n    ```\n\n\n# What is a GAM, and 1d smoothers\n\nOn Day 1, we covered:\n\n-   Example data: Temperature with depth\n-   Refresher on GLMs (regression, parameters, link functions)\n-   Why smooth?\n-   Simple models with `s()`\n-   Introduction to the data\n-   Adding more than one smooth to your model\n-   `summary` and `plot`\n\nFollow the lecture and R script below:\n\n[Day 1 Script](scripts/01-intro-to-gams.R){.btn .btn-success role=\"button\"}\n[Day 1 Solutions](scripts/01-intro-to-gams-solutions.R){.btn .btn-success role=\"button\"}\n\n<iframe width=\"780\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://pedersen-fisheries-lab.github.io/one-day-gam-workshop/slides/00-Course-intro.html#1\" title=\"Introduction to GAMs\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe width=\"780\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://pedersen-fisheries-lab.github.io/one-day-gam-workshop/slides/01-1D-smoothing.html#1\" title=\"What are GAMs?\"></iframe>\n\n\n# \"Twiddling knobs in `gam`\"\n\nOn Day 2, we covered:\n\n-   Moving beyond normal data (richness, shrimp biomass)\n    -   Exponential family and conditionally exp family (i.e., `family` + `tw` + `nb`)\n    \n-   More dimensions (Shrimp biomass)\n    -   Thin-plate 2d (Shrimp biomass with space)\n    -   What are tensors?

This is a great paper laying out how basis functions are used to model complex spatially structured systems. \n\n- The `mgcVis` package has more tools for plotting GAM model outputs.
