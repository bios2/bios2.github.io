Data science uses a variety of methods to extract knowledge from multi-dimensional information systems to address a wide range of applications and disciplines. The increasing availability of information on biodiversity and its changes also comes with a challenge of communication and representation, not only to scientists but also to policy makers and the general public. Biodiversity science is no exception and quantitative ecologists are called upon to develop communication techniques and tools to assist decision making. This process, often referred to as business intelligence, relies on a set of skills that range from consulting with partners to the production of interactive applications, through the creation of data models and analysis schemes.\n\nAt the end of this course, students will be able to conceptualize and develop a communication strategy based on biodiversity data to meet the needs of a partner.\n\nUpon completion of this course, students will be able to:\n\n+ Formulate an intervention plan based on business intelligence principles\n+ Identify the information needs of a partner\n+ Characterize the profile of data users\n+ Set up a data model specific to the communication strategy\n+ Conceptualize an interactive dashboard in the form of a model\n\n## Pedagogical approach\n\nThe course is based on a strategic communication mandate for a partner organization. Students will conduct a consultation to identify information needs and develop the appropriate data model. Sessions consist of short lectures on theoretical concepts presented by specialists from different disciplines, interspersed with specific exercises designed to practice the elements taught and apply them to their consulting problem. The projects are based on data organized and distributed by Biodiversité Québec.\n\n## Materials\n\n### Day 1: Monday, August 22\n\nThe first day of the course was focused on initiating a mandate with partners.\n\nThe session covered:\n\n+ Introduction to the course\n+ Presentation of partners\n+ Consultation workshop\n\nParticipants prepared their first __deliverable__: Schematization of the consultation mandate.\n\nView the presentation for this session below:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21335004/embed?show_title=0\" width=\"580\" height=\"425\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n### Day 2: Tuesday, August 23\n\nThe second day of the course was focused on business intelligence and design, with guest expert Daniel Chamberland-Tremblay from the École de Gestion at Université de Sherbrooke.\n\nThe session covered:\n\n+ Business Intelligence Principles\n+ Mike2.0 methodology\n+ Elements of design\n+ Development of persona and user journey\n\nParticipants prepared a __deliverable__: User characterization grid.\n\nView the presentation for this session below:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21357207/embed?show_title=0\" width=\"580\" height=\"425\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n### Day 3: Wednesday, August 24\n\nThe third day of the course covered data models, biodiversity indicators, and media.  with guest expert Daniel Chamberland-Tremblay from the École de Gestion at Université de Sherbrooke.\n\n+ Data and information systems architecture\n+ Essential biodiversity variables\n+ Case study: Living Planet Index and Biodiversity Distribution Index\n+ Data journalism and digital storytelling\n\nParticipants prepared a __deliverable__: Conceptualization of the data and indicators model.\n\nView the presentation for this session below:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21335049/embed?show_title=0\" width=\"580\" height=\"425\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n### Day 4: Thursday, August 25\n\nThe fourth day focused on interactive dashboards and data visualisation principles.\n\nThe session covered:\n\n+ Dashboard design\n+ For an effective visualization\n+ Visualization tools and technologies\n+ Model design using Figma\n\nParticipants prepated a __deliverable__: Interactive dashboard model.\n\nView the presentation \"Data visualization design: process and principles\" by guest expert Thomas Hurtut [__here__](https://bit.ly/dataviz_uds).\n\n### Day 5: Friday, August 26\n\nOn the final day, participants completed and presented their projects to the group and to their partners. \n\nThe session covered:\n\n+ Figma workshop (continuation and end)\n+ Presentation of the models\n+ Exchanges with the partners\n\nThere is no presentation for this day.\n",
