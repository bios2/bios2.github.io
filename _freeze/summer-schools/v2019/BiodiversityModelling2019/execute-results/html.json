The course took the form of lectures and practical exercises that covered a variety of methods used to model biodiversity, complemented by guest speakers.\"\nauthor:\n  - name: \"Dominique Gravel\"\n    affiliation: Université de Sherbrooke\n  - name: \"Guillaume Blanchet\"\n    affiliation: Université de Sherbrooke\ndate: \"2019-08-18\"\ntoc: true\nnumber-sections: true\nnumber-depth: 1\n---\n\n\n# Biodiversity Modelling 2019\n\nThe 2019 edition of the Biodiversity Modelling Summer School was presented by Dominique Gravel and Guillaume Blanchet (Université de Sherbrooke) as well as several invited speakers. \n\nIt took place from August 18 to August 23 2019 in the form of a retreat at Orford Musique in the Eastern Townships.\n\nThe intensive summer school is supported by Université de Sherbrooke and the NSERC-CREATE Training program in computational biodiversity science and services BIOS².\n\n## General objective \n\nBiodiversity modeling has become an integral part of the work of biologists in basic ecology, conservation biology, and evolutionary biology. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to use different approaches to biodiversity modeling and understand the limitations of various ecological data. Students will also be able to understand the basics of various approaches used to predict different facets of biodiversity (e.g. species distribution, ecological network structure) and to use them in their own research. Finally, the student will also be able to apply the approaches discussed during the course to identify biodiversity issues in a given region and assist in decision-making.\n\nUpon completion of this course, students will be able to:\n\n- Use different techniques for modeling biodiversity (statistics, differential equations, stochastic simulations)\n- Use climate change model outputs for biodiversity simulation\n- Create biodiversity scenarios based on the analysis of empirical data;\n- Critique scenario simulation methods\n- Evaluate sources of uncertainty in biodiversity projections \n\n## Pedagogical approach\n\nThe sessions consisted of short lectures on basic concepts, interspersed with specific exercises designed to practice the elements taught. The sessions were complemented by the analysis of applied problems that make use of the discussed models. The sessions were complemented by discussions on the characteristics of the approaches presented and their usefulness in practical settings. Students were asked to complete an integrative data analysis project throughout the week of intensive training.\n\n## Materials\n\n### Day 1: Overview of modelling techniques\n\nView the presentation for this session below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"shareagain\" style=\"min-width:300px;margin:1em auto;\" data-exeternal=\"1\">\n<iframe src=\"pres/day1.html\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" style=\"border:2px solid currentColor;\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<script>fitvids('.shareagain', {players: 'iframe'});</script>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Day 2: Tuesday, August 23\n\nThe second day of the course was focused on business intelligence and design, with guest expert [Daniel Chamberland-Tremblay](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/ecole-gestion/personnel/professeurs/simqg/daniel-chamberland-tremblay) from the École de Gestion at Université de Sherbrooke.\n\nThe session covered:\n\n+ Business Intelligence Principles\n+ Mike2.0 methodology\n+ Elements of design\n+ Development of persona and user journey\n\nParticipants prepared a __deliverable__: User characterization grid.\n\nView the presentation for this session below:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21357207/embed?show_title=0\" width=\"580\" height=\"425\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n### Day 3: Wednesday, August 24\n\nThe third day of the course covered data models, biodiversity indicators, and media.\n\n+ Data and information systems architecture\n+ Essential biodiversity variables\n+ Case study: Living Planet Index and Biodiversity Distribution Index\n+ Data journalism and digital storytelling\n\nParticipants prepared a __deliverable__: Conceptualization of the data and indicators model.\n\nView the presentation for this session below:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21335049/embed?show_title=0\" width=\"580\" height=\"425\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n### Day 4: Thursday, August 25\n\nThe fourth day focused on interactive dashboards and data visualisation principles with guest expert Thomas Hurtut, a [professor at Polytechnique Montréal](http://www.professeurs.polymtl.ca/thomas.hurtut/) and co-founder of [Kashika studio](https://kashika.studio/).\n\nThe session covered:\n\n+ Dashboard design\n+ For an effective visualization\n+ Visualization tools and technologies\n+ Model design using Figma\n\nParticipants prepated a __deliverable__: Interactive dashboard model.\n\nView the presentation \"Data visualization design: process and principles\" by guest expert Thomas Hurtut [__here__](https://bit.ly/dataviz_uds).\n\n### Day 5: Friday, August 26\n\nOn the final day, participants completed and presented their projects to the group and to their partners. \n\nThe session covered:\n\n+ Figma workshop (continuation and end)\n+ Presentation of the models\n+ Exchanges with the partners\n\nThere is no presentation for this day.\n\n## More information\n\nVisit the course homepage [here](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/ecoles-de-pointe/en/2022-biodiversity-modelling) and learn more about the course content and format [here](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/ecoles-de-pointe/en/home/biology/2022-biodiversity-modelling/content-and-format).\n",
