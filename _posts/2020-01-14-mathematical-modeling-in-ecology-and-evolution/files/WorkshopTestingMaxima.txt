We'll use wxMaxima as a free alternative.  

On a Mac, install using the instructions here:
https://themaximalist.org/about/my-mac-os-installation/

For other file systems, download here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/maxima/files/

When you first open Maxima, it will give you a choice of GUIs, chose wxMaxima.  Once wxMaxima is launched type this command and hit return to see if it answers 4:

2+2;

If it doesn't, then scan the installation document for the error that you run into (or email me).

If it does return 4, then type in and enter these commands:

diff(x^3, x);

wxplot2d (3*x, [x, 0, 2*%pi]);

load("solve_rec")$
solve_rec(x[t+1] = A*x[t], x[t], x[0]=x0);

load("distrib")$
pdf_normal(x,0,1);

You should see these answers: (a) 3 x^2, (b) a plot of a line, (c) x[t]=A^t*x0, and (d) %e^(-x^2/2)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(%pi)). 
 
If you get errors, let me know.
