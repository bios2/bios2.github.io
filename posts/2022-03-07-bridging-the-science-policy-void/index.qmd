description: "Do you think science should influence policy? Do you wonder how to improve evidence-based decision making? Do you have a particular issue that you would like to bring to the attention of decision makers? This workshop covers how to present science in a more impactful way, how to prepare a brief, and encourages participants to meet with a decision maker to discuss the issue raised in their policy brief."
