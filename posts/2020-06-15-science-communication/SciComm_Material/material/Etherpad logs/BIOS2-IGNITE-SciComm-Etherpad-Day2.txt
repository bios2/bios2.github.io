Activity 1: Piece together the blog post!

We mixed up the key passages from a blog post here. Put it back together in groups! The point is not necessarily to get it in the original order, but to think about how each passage is contributing to the story.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Pv0um1qp4WyrdLXU3hRhyLXcJOp8qayOcL1k_-IEbU/edit?usp=sharing (Make a copy of the document if you want to move the passages around!)

Some discussion points for your group discussions:
    - Which passages do you think are meant to introduce the topic (i.e. to catch reader interest, make it relatable, etc.)
    "During these stressful times..."
    "while people have retreated in their homes..."
    - Are any of these passages trying to encourage certain emotions in the reader? Which ones?
    "we need to build a new relationship..."
    "There will be a strong desire..." > frustration
    hope (sight of animals having more space)
    - Can you find the key message?
    a new relationship with nature is needed
    - Is there an answer to the reader's "so what"?
    if we don't, it'll be worse : "But if we follow this path without an altogether different mindset, we may end up back in the exact same place we are now or some place even worse."
