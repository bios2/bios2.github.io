The [Computational Biodiversity Science and Services (BIOS²)](https://bios2.usherbrooke.ca/) training program is a NSERC’s Collaborative Research and Training Experience (CREATE) Program. 

BIOS² co-PIs and fellows contribute and participate in training modules and intensive Biodiversity Modelling summer schools that cover a wide range of technical and essential soft skills, to prepare the next generation of highly qualified professionals and researchers for the Canadian labour market. 

Past trainings are openly accessible below. Look for upcoming trainings on the [BIOS² website](https://bios2.usherbrooke.ca/category/training-events/).
