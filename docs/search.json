    "text": "1 Foreword\nWelcome to the 2024 edition of our Summer School in Biodiversity Modelling!\nThe theme for this year is “Indicators to monitor biodiversity changes”, and we’ll discuss metrics to assess the health, diversity, and distribution of species, ecosystems, and genetic variability within an environment. These indicators provide valuable insights into the status and trends of biodiversity over time, helping to inform conservation efforts, policy-making, and sustainable development practices. By tracking these indicators, scientists and policymakers can monitor changes in biodiversity, identify areas of concern, prioritize conservation actions, and evaluate the effectiveness of conservation strategies. That’s why the program will navigate through a variety of topics, such as data pipelines, finances, communication and policy. We hope to immerse you in the complexity of this task which is the monitoring of biodiversity, and to reassure the need for interdisciplinary thinking.\n\nIf you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\n\nHere you will find the shared materials to help you prepare, as well as tutorials that you can use during the course.\nEnjoy!\nThis course is presented by the Université de Sherbrooke, as part of the BIOS2 training program.\n\n\n2 Slides\nTo access the slides for the presentations made during the Summer School, please click here.\n\n\n3 Other resources\nFor additional resources, such as tutorials, information and notes documents, please click here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n     \n     \n       Order By\n       Default\n         \n          Date - Oldest\n        \n         \n          Date - Newest\n        \n         \n          Author\n        \n     \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 13, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
