# Solution 1.1.

Marginal probability : 

$P(A=1) = P(A_{10})+P(A_{11}) = 0.15 + 0.05 = 0.2$

Conditional probability : 

$P(A=1|B=0) = \frac{P(A=1,B=0)}{P(B=0)} = \frac{0.15}{1 - (0.20 + 0.05)} = 0.2$

---

# Exercise 1.3. 

What is the probability there is not a single seed ?

$P(s=0) = (1-0.01)*(1-0.2)*(1-0.17)*(1-0.24)*(1-0.06)

$P(s=0) = 0.47$

What is the probability to pick at least one seed in the trap ? 

$P(n>0) = 1-P(s>0) = 0.53$

---

# Exercise 1.4. 

Under this hypothesis, sites and species are considered independent. The probability that a given species $i$ is located at both sites is therefore obtained by the square of regional prevalence. We have to sum them across species to get $N_{11}$, such that we get : 

$N_{11} = 0.22*0.22 + 0.15*0.15+0.37*0.37 = 0.21 $

We could do the same with the complements to obtain $N_{10}$ and $N_{01}$. Note these are symetrical : 

$N_{10} = 0.22*(1-0.22)+0.15*(1-0.15)+0.37*(1-0.37)=0.53$

And the resulting expected Jaccard index is : 

$J(A,B) = \frac{0.21}{0.21+.53+.53}=0.17$

---

# Solution 1.4.

In this situation composition of the two sites will depend on $D_{xy}$. We will therefore define a function to compute the different quantities necessary for the Jaccard. 

Occurrence of species $i$ at two sites is a joint probability. We will consider that the occurrence probability at site $A$ is given by regional prevalence and then use conditional probability (the function) to derive the joint probability :  

$P(A_i = 1, B_i = 1) = P(B_i = 1 |A_i = 1)P(A_i = 1)$

---

# Solution 1.4.

Then we need to get the complement, for only site A but not site B : 

$P(A_i = 1, B_i = 0) = P(B_i = 0 |A_i)P(A_i = 1)$

And the inverse : 

$P(A_i = 0, B_i = 1) = P(B_i = 1 |A_i = 0)P(A_i = 0)$

We finally follow the previous recipe to compute the Jacccard index. 

---

# Solution 1.5. 

Marginal occurrence probability at optimal climate is $P(X=1|E^+) = 0.2$

Conditional occurrence probability at optimal climate and habitat is $P(X1|E^+, H^+)=0.8$

Conditional occurrence probability at optimal climate but poor habitat is $P(X1|E^+, H^-)=0.05$

---

# Solution 1.5. 

Using rules of probability, we get $P(H^+$ as follows :

$P(X=1|E^+) = P(X=1|E^+,H^+)P(H^+)+ P(X=1|E^+,H^-)P(H^-)$

$P(X=1|E^+) = P(X=1|E^+,H^+)P(H^+)+ P(X=1|E^+,H^-)(1-P(H^+))$

$P(H^+) = \frac{P(X|E^+)-P(X|E^+,H^-)}{P(X|E^+,H^+)-P(X|E^+,H^-)}$

$P(H^+) = \frac{0.20-0.05}{0.80-0.05}$

$P(H^+) = 0.2$

---

# Solution 1.6.

We first have to define the quantities properly. First thing, define what you are looking for : 

$P(link | obs)$ : the probability there is an interaction given the observation 

And then the additional data given in the problem : 

$P(obs | link)$ : the probability of the observation given the hypothesis there is a link
$P(link)$ : prior knowledge on the probability there is a link

---

# Solution 1.6.

Using Bayes theorem, we have the following solution : 

$P(link | obs) = \frac{P(obs|link)P(link)}{P(obs)}$

We define the occurrence of an interaction a success of a bernouilli trial. For the numerator, we use the binomial distribution with $5$ observations to find that the probability of observing no interaction with associated probability $P(link)$ is :

$P(obs|link) = 0.33 $

---

# Solution 1.6.

The trick is often to compute the denominator. It's easy to conceive the first part : 

$P(obs|link)*P(link) = 0.33 x 0.20 $

The second one needs more thought but it's obvious at the end : 

$P(obs|link = 0)P(link = 0) = 1 x 0.80$

Which gives the denominator : 

$P(obs) = 0.33 x 0.20 + 1 x 0.80$

---

# Solution 1.6. 

Collecting the pieces together, we obtain the following answer : 

$P(link | obs) = \frac{0.33 x 0.20}{0.33 x 0.20 + 1 x 0.8} = 0.076$

This is the probability the two species interact given the observations derived using prior information.
