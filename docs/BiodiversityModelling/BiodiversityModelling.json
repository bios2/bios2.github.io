Think of a way you can collect some numbers. These should be numbers that can collect yourself ‚Äì no simulation, and no data from the internet! Things like the weights of shoes in your house, people on a train car, time between shots on goal in a hockey game. Choose something you like, and which you can measure in a relatively brief period of time.\nStep 2. Think about the kind of statistical distribution that might represent this phenomenon! Write it down. Why does this distribution seem to match your data? is it constrained in some way?\nStep 3. Collect some observations ‚Äì aim for a good number, at least 15 or so.\nStep 4. Type in these data and visualize them. Do they match your hypothesized distribution?

Return to your hypothesized distribution. Find its random number generation function (e.g.¬†rbinom() for the Binomial Distribution). Experiment with different parameters values to create data that looks close to your own data.\nStep 2. Attempt to fit the same parameters by Maximum likelihood. If you distribution has two parameters, fix one and find the Maximum Likelihood value of the other. Stretch goal Try to fit both of them at once.\nStep 3. Look at the help for ?MASS::fitdistr(). Try to use it to find your distribution parameters.\nContinuous distributions\ndistribution\npositive or negative?\nQuick description\nNormal\npositive or negative values\nCan result from many small effects added together\nLornormal\npositive values only\nresults from many things multiplied together\nGamma\npositive values only\ncan be the time to wait for a given number of things to happen\nExponential\nPositive only\nLengths of time between random events\nBeta\nPositive only\nBetween 0 and 1.

Run it, then work with the data.frame it creates!\nOne parameter\nOne-parameter exponential distribution\nYou are watching a female bird visiting her nest, bringing back food for nestlings. Every time she comes back you write down the number of minutes since the last visit. You watch for 20 consecutive visits. This species brings food once every 10 minutes, so six times an hour, and visits are prefectly random. This implies an Exponential distribution with a rate of \\(6\\text{visits} / 60\\text{minutes}\\) so in other words \\(0.1\\) visits per minute. Use maximum likelihood to confirm this number\n\n\nvisit_rate <- 6/60\nset.seed(1859)\ntime_between_visit <- rexp(20, rate = visit_rate)\nbird_visits <- data.frame(times = time_between_visit)\n\nhist(time_between_visit)\n\n\n\n\nQuestions / thoughts:\nBegin by trying only positive numbers in your algorithm.\nRun the the following rexp(1, -1). What happens? Why?\nHow would you constrain your algorithm to use only positive numbers?\nMonarch Butterfly numbers\nYou are concerned about Monarchs, so you‚Äôve decided to count their eggs! You look on 50 milkweed plants in your neighbourhood to find them. The eggs follow a perfect Poisson distribution with a mean of 120 eggs per plant.\n\n\nmean_eggs <- 120\nset.seed(1859)\ncounted_eggs <- rpois(50, mean_eggs)\negg_data <- data.frame(counted_eggs)\n\nhist(counted_eggs)\n\n\n\n\nYou want to use Maximum Likelihood to look at this distribution. You want to be extra careful, so you want to do it two ways.\nFirst, you try to fit a Poisson distribution like this:\n\\[\n\\text{eggs} \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)\n\\]\nyou do this by searching over values of lambda between 1 and 200\nLambda can‚Äôt be 0 or negative. You decide to replace the value of \\(\\lambda\\) with a function that is always greater than 0:\n\\[\nf(x) = e^x\n\\]\n\n\ncurve(exp(x), xlim = c(-3, 3))\n\n\n\n\nSince this function is always positive, and \\(\\lambda\\) is always positive, you decide to put the function in for the \\(\\lambda\\) of the Poisson:\n\\[\n\\text{eggs} \\sim \\text{Poisson}(e^x)\n\\]\nQuestions:\nNow what values should you use for \\(x\\) ?\nAre your answers from the two methods the same?\nDifference between two normal distributions (part I)\nYou add some fertilizer to plants, because experiments. This makes the plants grow more on average, because physiology. At the end of your experiment, you cut all the plants down and measure their dry biomass, because tradition.\nAs a skilled botanist, you know that the standard deviation of the control plots will be exactly 5g, and the standard deviation of the treatment plants will be *exactly the same. You know that plants are on average 200g, and the fertilizer should increase this by 30g (a 15% increase).\n\n\nreal_difference <- 30\nset.seed(1859)\ncontrol_plants <- rnorm(300, mean = 200, sd = 5)\n\ntreated_plants <- rnorm(300, mean = 200 + real_difference, sd = 5)\n\nplant_growth <- rbind(\n  data.frame(treatment = 0, mass = control_plants),\n  data.frame(treatment = 1, mass = treated_plants)\n)\n\npar(mfrow = c(2,1))\nhist(control_plants, breaks = 15)\nhist(treated_plants, breaks = 15)\n\n\n\npar(mfrow = c(1,1))\n\n\n\nQuestions\nWhat is the likelihood for the observations? Consider that you know the control mean (\\(\\mu\\)), the standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)). What is missing? Call this missing quantity \\(\\alpha\\).\nUse maximum likelihood to confirm that the difference is really 30g\nDifference between two normal distributions part (II)\nThe fertilizer makes plants grow, but affects different plants differently, because genetics.\nAs a VERY skilled geneticist, you know that the standard deviation of the control plots will be exactly 5g, but now you also know the standard deviation of the treatment plants will be exactly 9g. You know that plants are on average 200g, and the fertilizer should increase this by 30g (a 15% increase).\n\n\nreal_difference <- 30\nset.seed(1859)\ncontrol_plants2 <- rnorm(300, mean = 200, sd = 5)\n\ntreated_plants2 <- rnorm(300, mean = 200 + real_difference, sd = 9)\n\nplant_growth2 <- rbind(\n  data.frame(treatment = 0, mass = control_plants),\n  data.frame(treatment = 1, mass = treated_plants)\n)\n\npar(mfrow = c(2,1))\nhist(control_plants2, breaks = 15)\nhist(treated_plants2, breaks = 15)\n\n\n\npar(mfrow = c(1,1))\n\n\n\nQuestions\nWhat is the likelihood for the observations? Consider that you know the control mean (\\(\\mu\\)), the control standard deviation (\\(\\sigma_c\\)) and the treatment standard deviation (\\(\\sigma_t\\)). How is this different from the first equation?\nUse maximum likelihood to confirm that the difference is really 30g\nIs the likelihood profile different from the first exercise? that is, does the plot of likelihood values (y axis) against parameter values (x axis) look the same?\n\n\n\n",
